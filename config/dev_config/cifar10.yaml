run: # Configurations for a specific run
  random_seed: 1234 # Integer number of specifying random seed
  log_dir: target # String for indicating where to save all the information, including models and computed signals. We can reuse the models saved in the same log_dir.

  type: pytorch # Training framework (we only support pytorch now).
  num_target_model: 1 #Integer number for indicating how many target models we want to audit for the privacy game
  epochs: 3 # Integer number for indicating the epochs for training target model. For speedyresnet, it uses its own number of epochs.
  batch_size: 128 # Integer number for indicating batch size for training the target model. For speedyresnet, it uses its own batch size.
  optimizer: SGD # String which indicates the optimizer. We support Adam and SGD. For speedyresnet, it uses its own optimizer.
