# Lenght-of-Stay Usecase
In this use case, we focus on attacking length-of-stay classifier models. As part of the example, we train a Logistic Regression model and a Gated Recurrent Unit with Decay (GRU-D). When attacking these models, ensure you update the necessary parameters in the ```audit.yaml ``` file accordingly.
