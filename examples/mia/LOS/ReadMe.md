# Lenght-of-Stay Usecase
In this use case, we focus on attacking length-of-stay classifier models. As part of the example, we train a Logistic Regression model and a Gated Recurrent Unit with Decay (GRU-D).
<br>
To run the use case follow these stpes:<br>
1. Prepare the data following instructions in ```mimic_prepration/ReadMe.md ``` 
2. Run ```mimic_dataset_prep.ipynb ``` to create the mimic dataset
3. RUN!!!
