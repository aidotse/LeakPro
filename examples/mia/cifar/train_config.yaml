run: # Configurations for a specific run
  random_seed: 1236 # Integer number of specifying random seed
  log_dir: target_dpsgd # String for indicating where to save all the information, including models and computed signals. We can reuse the models saved in the same log_dir.

train: # Configuration for training
  epochs: 2 # Integer number for indicating the epochs for training target model. For speedyresnet, it uses its own number of epochs.
  batch_size: 32 # Integer number for indicating batch size for training the target model. For speedyresnet, it uses its own batch size.
