class LinkabilityEvaluator(BaseModel):
    """Measure the linkability risk created by a synthetic dataset.

    The linkability risk is measured from the success of a linkability attack.
    The attack is modeled along the following scenario. The attacker posesses
    two datasets, both of which share some columns with the *original* dataset
    that was used to generate the synthetic data. Those columns will be
    referred to as *auxiliary columns*. The attacker's aim is then to use the
    information contained in the synthetic data to connect these two datasets,
    i.e. to find records that belong to the same individual.

    To model this attack, the original dataset is split vertically into two
    parts. Then we try to reconnect the two parts using the synthetic data
    by looking for the closest neighbors of the split original records in
    the synthetic data. If both splits of an original record have the same
    closest synthetic neighbor, they are linked together. The more original
    records get relinked in this manner the more successful the attack.

    A linkability risk of 1 means that every single attacked record
    could be successfully linked together. A linkability risk of 0
    means that no links were found at all.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ori : pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe containing original data.
    syn : pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe containing synthetic data.
        It has to have the same columns as df_ori.
    aux_cols : tuple of two lists of strings
        Features (columns) of data that are given to the attacker as auxiliary information.
        First/second tuple represents first/second original dataset.
    n_attacks : int, default is min(2_000, ori.shape[0]).
        Number of records to attack.
    confidence_level : float, default is 0.95
        Confidence level for the error bound calculation.
    n_neighbors : int, default is 1
        The number of closest neighbors to include in the main attack for linking.
        The default of 1 means that the linkability attack is considered
        successful only if the two original record split have the same
        synthetic record as closest neighbor.
    n_jobs : int, default is -2
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
    main_links: LinkabilityIndexes, optional
        LinkabilityIndexes object holding main attack links.
        Parameter will be set in evaluate method.
    naive_links: LinkabilityIndexes, optional
        LinkabilityIndexes object holding naive attack links.
        Parameter will be set in evaluate method.
    results: EvaluationResults, optional
        EvaluationResults object containing the success rates for the various attacks.
